# SHMC
This is the code for our SHMC model from "Enhancing Fine-Grained Ship Classification in Remote Sensing Images Through Self-Heterogeneous Multi-Expert Collaboration"

We have uploaded the core codes of our hierarchical feature extraction module, selfheterogeneous multi-expert branch module, and knowledge transfer module in SHMC.

You can follow "https://github.com/JACYI/EFM-Net-Pytorch.git" to obtain the dataset and reproduce the SHMC Net.

The complete codes and trained models will be re-organized and uploaded as soon as possible!
